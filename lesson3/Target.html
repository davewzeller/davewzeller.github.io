       <h3>The Smith Family</h3><br>
            <p>The Smith family's parents are trying to get the teenagers outside 
             away from the TV screens. They have teenage kids, two daughters, 
             and two sons. In the last couple of years, the kids have been 
             spending more time on computers and phones. They're concerned 
             that their kids are not experiencing anything outside the little
             screens. The Smiths want to look up the weather and outdoor activities
             for the whole family. </p><br>
        <h3>Max and Ali</h3><br>
        <p>
            Max and Allie are newlywed couples who don't have a lot of money and
            even less time to spend. They're looking for low-cost ideas to be able
            to spend more time together. They were thinking of a picnic or hike
            or even a free concert. They are deftly fair-weather people who don't
            want to get too hot or too cold. They're still in the honeymoon 
            phase of their marriage want to be together as much as possible.
